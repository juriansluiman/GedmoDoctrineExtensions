GedmoDoctrineExtensions
===
This module is not required anymore to use the Gedmo Doctrine Extensions for your Zend Framework. The support for this module is dropped and through a very simple configuration you can supply the extensions yourself.

More information about the removal and how to load the extensions is written at my blog: http://juriansluiman.nl/en/article/116/use-the-gedmo-doctrine-extensions-in-zend-framework-2
